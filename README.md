# AI-Web-Builder



## NOTES FOR SELF

* Consulting agent is done, but it has been scaled down for now so that the process can be sped up. (commented)

* Email sending works, but only to eimamiyasaka@gmail.com for now because I am using the default domain provided by resend. (commented)

* The report in the email is not yet in a downloadable format.

* Still many debugging lines. (not really an issue)

* FROM_EMAIL in .env is redundant.

* test-email.ts still exists for reference.

* Weather workflow still exists in workflows/index.ts for reference.

* Repo name is the only input into the webBuilder workflow for now, but it successfully makes a new repo on my Github and initialises React with Vite.

### Next steps

Make the document sent in the email downloadable, and inputtable into the workflow.
Start developing the web dev part of the workflow.
